> Accessible through a variety of different technologies, including mobile devices or assistive technologies.
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
> I will say that as developers we have to keep ourselves updated with OWASP like injection, broken authentication,
> security misconfiguration, etc.
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
>* you can run your tests in the real world
>* not quite sure, but i think it also increases your code coverage, by telling you what you haven't test.
>* It deploys to production for you.
7. What are some continuous integration tools?
