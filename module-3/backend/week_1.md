## Week One - Module 3

Some of these questions are from this week, some are from previous weeks, and some are new concepts. Try answering without research first. If you are not sure, take a guess but acknowledge that it's a guess (faking an answer in an interview without acknowledging it as a guess is a bad idea). Follow up with the necessary research to understand these concepts. These tend to be common themes during the job hunt and are worth having a solid understanding of.

1. What is `json`, what does it stand for, and why is it important?
1. What kind of object is JSON in Ruby? How do we know it's JSON?
1. What's an API?
1. What's a RESTful API? How does that look in Rails?
1. What is an ORM, what does it stand for, and why is it helpful?
1. How do you create a record in the following table in SQL? In Active Record?   
   (Users table with columns first_name, last_name, email, and age)
1. How would you refactor this method?

```
def people_with_brown_hair
  people_with_brown_hair = []

  people.each do |person|
    if person.hair_color == "brown"
      people_with_brown_hair << person
    end
  end

  people_with_brown_hair
end
```

1. Given an array numbers = [1,2,3,4,5], find the sum of the doubles of all the numbers.  

#### Self Assessment  
Rate yourself on the following scale.  
4  I know and understand all these concepts and did not have to look anything up  
3  I know and understand most of these concepts but had to look something up  
2  I am uncertain about some of these concepts and had to look some things up ^^  
1  I am feeling lost about with these concepts and had to look many things up ^^  

^^ Please let an instructor know where you'd like support to catch you up.
